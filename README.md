# qmbenchio
An open-source benchmark IO project.

![screenshot](docs/images/benchio_logo.png)

## Goals and Objectives

* Develop a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between quantum chemistry software, computing architecture, and simulation performance
* Investigation of storage technology impact on computation times on different scratch disk clusters

Our project begins with the utilization of OpenMOLCAS, a widely-acclaimed and extensively-used quantum chemistry software package, as part of the (ATTOP) project.
